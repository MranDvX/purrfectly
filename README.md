# üê± Purrfectly

Welcome to Purrfectly, the ultimate online shopping destination for pet owners! Our unique feature, shoppable videos, allows you to see our pet products in action, used by its final consumers, our mascots! And if you fall in love with one of the animals that appears in the videos, you can even adopt them, as they are in need of a home.

## Features
- Shoppable videos: This feature allows you to see our pet products in action, used by real mascots.
- Pet adoption: You can adopt one of our mascots if you fall in love with them.
- Wide selection of pet products: We offer a wide variety of high-quality products for all your pet's needs.
- Blog-like section with tips and care about your pets.

This project aims to participate in [@midudev](https://www.github.com/midudev) hackathon in collaboration with [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps
A `.env` file is needed with the following variables:
```
DATABASE_URL -> Connection URL of your primary database.
SHADOW_DATABASE_URL -> Connection URL of the shadow database needed by Prisma for migration operations.
SESSION_SECRET -> The session secret used by remix to handle cookie sessions.
VERCEL_FORCE_NO_BUILD_CACHE -> This is needed if deployed in Vercel in order for it to not cache models and avoid problems.
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME -> The cloud name of your cloudinary account.
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY -> Used to allow payments (test mode).
```

git clone https://github.com/ivsantos/purrfectly.git
